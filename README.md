# CSCI1620-850-Project
Final project for CSCI1620-850

- Due to my job I need to project how much work our practices will ask our athletes to do. This is important for health management as well as performance
- To do this I will have a repository of how much work our periods require per minute and multiply that by the time that we will do each part of the practice
- The code will store each practice as a seperate CSV so that it can be refered back to late to see how accurate the projection was and help explain what happened
